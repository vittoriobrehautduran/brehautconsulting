          "answer": "It starts with a conversation. You book a meeting through our booking system, and we discuss your business, goals, and current challenges. This helps us understand if we're a good fit and what approach would work best for you."

        {
          "question": "What happens during the first meeting?",
          "answer": "We listen to your situation, ask questions about your business and goals, and discuss what you're trying to achieve. It's a discovery conversation, not a sales pitch. By the end, you'll have clarity on whether we can help and what that might look like."

          "question": "Can I hire you for just a website or just ads?",
          "answer": "Yes. While we often work on integrated systems, we can focus on a single service if that's what you need. We'll be honest if we think you'd benefit from additional services, but the decision is yours."

          "question": "How is pricing structured?",
          "answer": "Pricing is based on project scope, complexity, and goals. We provide clear proposals after understanding your needs, so you know exactly what you're investing in and why."

        {
          "question": "Do you work internationally or only locally?",
          "answer": "We work with clients globally, with a focus on Europe and Latin America. Our services are delivered remotely, so location isn't a barrier as long as we can communicate effectively."

          "question": "Who owns the website, ads, and data?",
          "answer": "You do. The website code, content, and any data collected belong to you. We work with third-party platforms when needed, but you maintain ownership and control of your digital assets."
